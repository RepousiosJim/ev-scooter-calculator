Add option to toggle between standard, high-contrast, and dark high-contrast themes. Ensure battery level indicators and warning states remain distinguishable.\n\n**Rationale:** Users with low vision, color blindness, or those using devices outdoors in bright sunlight struggle with insufficient contrast. Performance metrics and safety warnings must be readable in all conditions. AAA compliance serves 8% of males with color vision deficiency.",
