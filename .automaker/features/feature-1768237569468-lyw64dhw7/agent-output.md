## Specification

### 1.

 Problem
Users currently upgrade simulations through a text-based comparison table that shows current vs.

 projected metrics.

 While functional, this lacks visual impact and makes it harder to quickly grasp the magnitude of performance changes.

 A visual chart would enhance the upgrade simulation experience by providing an intuitive graphical comparison of key metrics.

### 2.

 Solution
Integrate Chart.js library to render interactive bar charts that visually compare current vs.

 upgraded specifications (energy, range, speed, current draw) when users select an upgrade option.

 The chart will be displayed alongside the existing comparison table for enhanced visual context.

### 3.

 Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a user has entered scooter specifications, WHEN they select any upgrade option (parallel battery, voltage upgrade, or controller upgrade), THEN a bar chart is displayed showing visual comparison of current vs.

 upgraded values for Energy (Wh), Range (km), Top Speed (km/h), and Current Draw (A).
- GIVEN the chart is displayed, WHEN the user modifies any input parameter, THEN the chart is automatically cleared/hidden to reflect that the upgrade projection is no longer valid.
- GIVEN the chart is displayed, WHEN the user clicks "Clear Selection", THEN the chart is hidden.
- GIVEN the chart is rendered, WHEN the user hovers over any bar, THEN a tooltip displays the exact value and percentage change.
- GIVEN multiple upgrade selections, WHEN switching between upgrade types, THEN the chart updates smoothly with animated transitions showing the new comparison.

### 4.

 Files to Modify
| File | Purpose | Action |
|

------|

---------|

--------|
| index.html | Add chart container and Chart.js CDN library | modify |
| index.html | Initialize Chart.js instance and integrate with upgrade logic | modify |

### 5.

 Implementation Tasks
```tasks
- [ ] T001:

 Add Chart.js CDN library to the HTML head section | File:

 index.html
- [ ] T002:

 Create a chart canvas container element in the comparison view section | File:

 index.html
- [ ] T003:

 Initialize Chart.js instance and configure bar chart with current metrics labels | File:

 index.html
- [ ] T004:

 Create updateChart() function to refresh chart data when upgrades are selected | File:

 index.html
- [ ] T005:

 Integrate updateChart() call into applyUpgrade() function with current and projected data | File:

 index.html
- [ ] T006:

 Add chart cleanup to resetUpgrades() function to hide chart when selection is cleared | File:

 index.html
- [ ] T007:

 Ensure chart is hidden/cleared when input parameters change (calculate() function) | File:

 index.html
```

### 6.

 Verification
1.

 Open the application and enter scooter specifications
2.

 Click on any upgrade option (e.g., "Add Parallel Battery")
3.

 Verify a bar chart appears below the comparison table showing 4 metric comparisons
4.

 Hover over bars to verify tooltips display values and percentage changes
5.

 Click a different upgrade option and verify the chart animates to new values
6.

 Click "Clear Selection" and verify the chart disappears
7.

 Modify any input parameter and verify the chart (if visible) is hidden
