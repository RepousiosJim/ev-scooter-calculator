1.

 **Problem**:

 Users want to know how long it will take to charge their EV scooter battery with their specific charger.

 Currently, the calculator shows battery capacity (Wh) but doesn't have a way to estimate charging time based on the charger's amperage.

2.

 **Solution**:

 Add an input field for "Charger Amps" and calculate the estimated time to a full charge using the formula:

 Charge Time (hours) = Battery Wh / (Charger Amps × Battery Voltage).

 Display the result in hours and minutes format.

3.

 **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - GIVEN the calculator page is loaded, WHEN a user enters a value in the "Charger Amps" field, THEN the estimated time to a full charge is calculated and displayed in hours and minutes
   - GIVEN a battery with 52V and 16Ah (832Wh), WHEN charger amps is set to 5A, THEN the display shows approximately "3.

2 hours" (832Wh / (5A × 52V) = 3.

2 hours)
   - GIVEN the charger amps field is empty or zero, WHEN the calculator runs, THEN the charge time display shows "--" or "0h 0m"
   - GIVEN any input value changes (voltage, capacity, or charger amps), WHEN the calculation runs, THEN the charge time updates in real-time

4.

 **Files to Modify**:
   | File | Purpose | Action |
   |

------|

---------|

--------|
   | F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html | Main application file (HTML/CSS/JS) | modify |

5.

 **Implementation Tasks**:
   ```tasks
   - [ ] T001:

 Add "Charger Amps" input field to the Hardware Specs form section | File:

 F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html
   - [ ] T002:

 Add new stat box in Performance Estimate section to display "Time to Full Charge" | File:

 F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html
   - [ ] T003:

 Update JavaScript state management to include chargerAmps property | File:

 F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html
   - [ ] T004:

 Add DOM element reference for the charge time output | File:

 F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html
   - [ ] T005:

 Implement charge time calculation logic in calculate() function | File:

 F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html
   - [ ] T006:

 Update updateUI() function to display calculated charge time in hours and minutes format | File:

 F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html
   ```

6.

 **Verification**:

 
   - Open the HTML file in a browser
   - Enter 52V, 16Ah, and 5A charger amps
   - Verify the charge time shows approximately 3h 12m (832Wh / 260W = 3.

2 hours)
   - Change charger amps to 2A and verify charge time updates to approximately 8h
   - Clear the charger amps field and verify the display shows "--" or "0h 0m"

The implementation is complete! Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented all the tasks from the approved plan:

### ✅ T001: Added "Charger Amps" Input Field
- Added a new form field after "Riding Style" in the Hardware Specs section
- Includes label, input field (0.1-30A), unit display, and helper text
- Optional field - shows "e.g., 5" as placeholder

### ✅ T002: Added "Time to Full Charge" Stat Box
- Added a new stat box in the Performance Estimate section
- Spans 2 columns like the "Peak Current Draw" box
- Displays time in hours & minutes format

### ✅ T003: Updated State Management
- Added `chargerAmps: null` to the state object

### ✅ T004: Added DOM Element References
- Added `chargerAmps` reference to the inputs object
- Added `chargeTime` reference to the outputs object

### ✅ T005: Implemented Charge Time Calculation
- Formula: `Charge Time (hours) = Battery Wh / (Charger Amps × Battery Voltage)`
- Handles edge cases (empty/zero charger amps)
- Updates in real-time

### ✅ T006: Updated Display Logic
- Formats charge time as "Xh Xm" (e.g., "3h 12m")
- Shows "--" when charger amps is empty or zero

## Verification

The implementation meets all acceptance criteria:
- ✅ With 52V, 16Ah, and 5A charger: 832Wh / 260W = 3.2 hours → displays "3h 12m"
- ✅ Empty/zero charger amps shows "--"
- ✅ Real-time updates when any input changes

You can now open `F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html` in a browser to test the new charge time feature!

The implementation is complete! Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented all the tasks from the approved plan:

### ✅ T001: Added "Charger Amps" Input Field
- Added a new form field after "Riding Style" in the Hardware Specs section
- Includes label, input field (0.1-30A), unit display, and helper text
- Optional field - shows "e.g., 5" as placeholder

### ✅ T002: Added "Time to Full Charge" Stat Box
- Added a new stat box in the Performance Estimate section
- Spans 2 columns like the "Peak Current Draw" box
- Displays time in hours & minutes format

### ✅ T003: Updated State Management
- Added `chargerAmps: null` to the state object

### ✅ T004: Added DOM Element References
- Added `chargerAmps` reference to the inputs object
- Added `chargeTime` reference to the outputs object

### ✅ T005: Implemented Charge Time Calculation
- Formula: `Charge Time (hours) = Battery Wh / (Charger Amps × Battery Voltage)`
- Handles edge cases (empty/zero charger amps)
- Updates in real-time

### ✅ T006: Updated Display Logic
- Formats charge time as "Xh Xm" (e.g., "3h 12m")
- Shows "--" when charger amps is empty or zero

## Verification

The implementation meets all acceptance criteria:
- ✅ With 52V, 16Ah, and 5A charger: 832Wh / 260W = 3.2 hours → displays "3h 12m"
- ✅ Empty/zero charger amps shows "--"
- ✅ Real-time updates when any input changes

You can now open `F:\Desktop\EV Scooter Calc\index.html` in a browser to test the new charge time feature!
