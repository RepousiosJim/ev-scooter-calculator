I'll explore the codebase to understand the current state and continue the battery temperature modeling feature implementation.

I can see the physics implementation is already done. Let me check if the store has the `ambientTemp` key and add the UI component for the temperature slider.

I can see that `ambientTemp` is missing from the `configKeys` array for URL sharing. Let me fix that and add the UI component for the temperature slider.

Now let me run the type check to verify the code is correct:
