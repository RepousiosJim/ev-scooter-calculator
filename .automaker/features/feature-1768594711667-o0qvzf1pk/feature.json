Use 3px outline with contrasting colors and ensure 2:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds. Add focus-within states for grouped controls.\n\n**Rationale:** Default browser focus indicators are often too subtle or missing on custom components like range sliders and scooter comparison toggles. Clear focus states are essential for keyboard users to track their position and understand which element will respond to their input.",
