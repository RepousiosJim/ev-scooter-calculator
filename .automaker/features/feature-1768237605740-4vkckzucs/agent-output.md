### Specification

1.

 **Problem**:

 Users want to see how regenerative braking affects their scooter's range.

 Currently, the calculator only shows base range consumption without accounting for energy recovered through regenerative braking.

2.

 **Solution**:

 Add a "Regen Strength" slider (0-100%) to the input form.

 Calculate estimated range recovery based on the slider value (scaling 0-15% of base range) and display both the recovery amount and the total adjusted range.

3.

 **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - GIVEN the EV Scooter Calculator page is loaded, WHEN the user adjusts the "Regen Strength" slider, THEN the range recovery percentage updates in real-time
   - GIVEN a base range calculation, WHEN regen strength is set to 100%, THEN up to 15% of base range is added as recovered range
   - GIVEN regen strength is 0%, WHEN calculations are performed, THEN no additional range is added to the base range
   - GIVEN regen strength is set, WHEN the range is displayed, THEN both the base range and total range (including regen) are shown
   - GIVEN any input change, WHEN calculations are performed, THEN the regen recovery is recalculated based on current parameters

4.

 **Files to Modify**:
   | File | Purpose | Action |
   |

------|

---------|

--------|
   | index.html | Add slider input and update calculations | modify |

5.

 **Implementation Tasks**:
   ```tasks
   - [ ] T001:

 Add regenStrength property to state object | File:

 index.html
   - [ ] T002:

 Add regenStrength input element in form section | File:

 index.html
   - [ ] T003:

 Add DOM reference for regenStrength input | File:

 index.html
   - [ ] T004:

 Implement range recovery calculation in calculate() function | File:

 index.html
   - [ [ ] T005:

 Add regen recovery display to results section | File:

 index.html
   - [ ] T006:

 Add DOM reference for regen recovery output | File:

 index.html
   - [ ] T007:

 Update updateUI() to pass and display regen recovery values | File:

 index.html
   ```

6.

 **Verification**:

 
   - Open the calculator in a browser
   - Adjust the "Regen Strength" slider from 0% to 100%
   - Verify that range recovery increases proportionally (e.g., 100% regen ≈ 15% of base range)
   - Verify that the total range equals base range + regen recovery
   - Check that all other calculations still work correctly

Now I need to add the output element for displaying the regen recovery. Let me add it to the stats grid:
*Thinking: Now*

*Thinking:  I*

*Thinking:  need*

*Thinking:  to*

*Thinking:  add*

*Thinking:  the*

*Thinking:  DOM*

*Thinking: Total*

*Thinking:  the*

Now I need to add the DOM references for the new output elements:

Now I need to update the calculate() function to read the regen strength and calculate the recovery:

The implementation is now complete. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## ✅ Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented the **Regen Strength slider** feature according to the approved plan. Here's what was added:

### Changes Made:

1. **State Management** - Added `regenStrength: 0` property to track the slider value (0-100%)

2. **UI Input** - Added a slider input for "Regen Strength (0-100%)" in the Hardware Specs form with:
   - A range slider (0-100, step 1)
   - Real-time percentage display
   - Helper text explaining its purpose

3. **Calculation Logic** - Implemented regen recovery calculation:
   - Formula: `regenRecovery = estRange × (regenStrength / 100) × 0.15`
   - At 100% regen strength: up to 15% of base range is recovered
   - At 50% regen strength: 7.5% of base range is recovered
   - At 0% regen strength: no additional range

4. **Output Display** - Added two new stat-boxes in the results section:
   - **Regen Recovery**: Shows the recovered range in kilometers
   - **Total Range (with Regen)**: Shows the combined base range + regen recovery

### How It Works:

- Users adjust the "Regen Strength" slider from 0% to 100%
- The calculator instantly updates the estimated range recovery
- Recovery scales linearly: 100% regen = 15% additional range, 50% = 7.5%, etc.
- Total range = Base range + Regen recovery

### Example:
With default settings (52V, 16Ah, 30Wh/km):
- Base range: ~27.7 km
- At 100% regen: +4.2 km recovery → Total: 31.9 km
- At 50% regen: +2.1 km recovery → Total: 29.8 km

The feature is fully functional and integrates seamlessly with the existing calculator!

The implementation is now complete. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## ✅ Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented the **Regen Strength slider** feature according to the approved plan. Here's what was added:

### Changes Made:

1. **State Management** - Added `regenStrength: 0` property to track the slider value (0-100%)

2. **UI Input** - Added a slider input for "Regen Strength (0-100%)" in the Hardware Specs form with:
   - A range slider (0-100, step 1)
   - Real-time percentage display
   - Helper text explaining its purpose

3. **Calculation Logic** - Implemented regen recovery calculation:
   - Formula: `regenRecovery = estRange × (regenStrength / 100) × 0.15`
   - At 100% regen strength: up to 15% of base range is recovered
   - At 50% regen strength: 7.5% of base range is recovered
   - At 0% regen strength: no additional range

4. **Output Display** - Added two new stat-boxes in the results section:
   - **Regen Recovery**: Shows the recovered range in kilometers
   - **Total Range (with Regen)**: Shows the combined base range + regen recovery

### How It Works:

- Users adjust the "Regen Strength" slider from 0% to 100%
- The calculator instantly updates the estimated range recovery
- Recovery scales linearly: 100% regen = 15% additional range, 50% = 7.5%, etc.
- Total range = Base range + Regen recovery

### Example:
With default settings (52V, 16Ah, 30Wh/km):
- Base range: ~27.7 km
- At 100% regen: +4.2 km recovery → Total: 31.9 km
- At 50% regen: +2.1 km recovery → Total: 29.8 km

The feature is fully functional and integrates seamlessly with the existing calculator!
